## Exercises

### Grammar of Graphics

* [grammar_of_graphics.ipynb](exercises/grammar_of_graphics/grammar_of_graphics.ipynb)

#### Learning Outcomes

* Understand the Grammar of Graphics
* Use the Grammar of Graphics with the `ggplot` module to produce plots from *aesthetics* and *geometric representations*.
* Use *layers* to produce new visualisations specifically to suit your data, showing data and statistical summaries
* Use multi-panel figures to display complex datasets

### Imaging 2D arrays, colormaps, and 3D surface plots

* [colormaps_surfaces_netcdf.ipynb](exercises/colormaps_surfaces_netcdf/colormaps_surfaces_netcdf.ipynb)

#### Learning Outcomes

* Read and use NetCDF format data using Python
* Visualise array data as a heatmap/image
* Explore array data visualisation with a range of colour palettes, and understand how selection and normalisation of colour palettes can influence the interpretation of data
* Visualise 2D array data as a 3D surface plot
* Explore the application and influence of colour palettes and lighting effects on the interpretation of 3D surface plots
